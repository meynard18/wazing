                     Most homeowners have never heard of this process "Screen &
                     Recoat" before. Screen and recoat is a good option for
                     light scratches and dullness on their hardwood floors that
                     are not in need of full sanding. But before we get too
                     deep, What exactly is Screen & Recoat? The process of
                     screen and recoat is performed to remove superficial
                     scratches, imperfections, and dullness look on your
                     hardwood floors. This allows a new coat of Polyurethane to
                     adhere to the existing top layer.

                  <p class="section-p">
                     Polyurethanes are plastic polymers made by combining
                     diisocyanates ( TDI and MDI) and polyols. Polyurethane wood
                     finish is used to coat surfaces, protecting them from
                     scratches and helping to resist water damage. Over time,
                     this protective plastic wears off, as it should, but make
                     sure to not let it expose down to its bare wood to not
                     cause any further damage.

                     Why you should screen your hardwood floors?
                  </h3>

                  <p class="section-p">
                     It is important to screen your wood floors to extend its
                     life before needing a full sanding. Wood Floor refinishing
                     will wear off over time, exposing the wood itself and
                     become more vulnerable to deep scratches, liquid spills,
                     etc that causes damage which results to having your wood
                     floor in need of replacing. We recommend to get your
                     hardwood floor refinish once every 2 Years to properly
                     maintain your floor and save you money from sanding
                     hardwood floors.

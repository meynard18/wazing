                     Wood floors not only add a touch of elegance to your home,
                     but also a bit of warmth. Many homeowners believe that
                     having hardwood floors even makes the space look bigger.
                     It's an easy way to make a great first impression. One of
                     the primary benefits of wood flooring is its versatility to
                     adapt to almost every interior design theme in your home.
                     No matter how often you are inspired to change the mirrors,
                     wall art, decorative accents or other decor in your home,
                     the floors will always look good and fit your desired
                     theme.

                  <p class="section-p">
                     Wood floors can add value to your home. When it comes time
                     for you to sell your home, buyers will pay more for a house
                     with hardwood than carpet. Many home buyers don’t want
                     carpet… especially somebody else’s carpet. They see used
                     carpet as a petri dish that is going to provoke their
                     allergy symptoms. Many home buyers would plan on replacing
                     carpets, which is why they will pay more for a house that
                     already has hardwood floors. Because it’s a feature sought
                     out, wood flooring may even help sell your house faster.

                  <p class="section-p">
                     One of the primary benefits of wood flooring is its
                     versatility to adapt to almost every interior design theme
                     in your home. No matter how often you are inspired to
                     change the mirrors, wall art, decorative accents or other
                     decor in your home, the floors will always look good and
                     fit your desired theme. Additionally, not only will wood
                     flooring not clash with your décor, but you have a wide
                     range of colors, shades, and species to choose from. With
                     real hardwood floors, you don’t get a factory pattern that
                     repeats every so often. You get natural beauty available
                     with a variety of shades, swirls, and grains that add
                     character to your home.
